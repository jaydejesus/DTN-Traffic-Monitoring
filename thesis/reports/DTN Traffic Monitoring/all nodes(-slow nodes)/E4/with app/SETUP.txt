Experiment 4 : Span/Range Experiment 
Goal: show that the app can gather data and analyze data to generate traffic information
NR_OF_SEEDS = 30 from [1, 30]
SIMULATION_DURATION = 1800 seconds or 30 minutes
NR_OF_NODE_GROUPS = 6
MOVEMENT_MODEL = ShortestPathMapBasedMovement
ROUTER = EpidemicRouter
POINTS_OF_INTEREST = 1 road, 2 pois only 100% probability to travel on that road
NODE_DISTRIBUTION:
//Groups 1,2,3 and Groups 4,5,6 are moving in opposite direction so that the traffic mechanism can be  shown easily
Group1
id = m
nrOfHosts = 30
speed = 8.0, 11.0

Group2
id = s
nrOfHosts = 10
speed = 0.3, 0.5

Group3
id = n
nrOfHosts = 10
speed = 8.0, 11.0

Group4
id = m
nrOfHosts = 30
speed = 8.0, 11.0

Group5
id = s
nrOfHosts = 10
speed = 0.3, 0.5

Group6
id = n
nrOfHosts = 10
speed = 8.0, 11.0
